    *Trusty* is a smart contract blockchain based product/service directed towards the individual or the business…<br/><br/>

Trusty is actually on Goerli, Sepolia and Mumbai Testnet network and allows you to create and manage an infinite number of 2/3 or 3/3 multi-signature smart-contracts/wallets, but it is possible to create also variants with specifications on request as its modularity and scalability make it a versatile and powerful tool for different applications.<br/><br/>

If you are afraid on the possible breach of a mnemonic phrase or of a single private key, you can use up to 2 more differents ones for the management of a single smart contract wallet with double or even triple security<br/><br/>

Is it possible to manage any ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 compatible Token.<br/><br/>

It can be used to build a safe vault or use several small abstract account and wallets to divide up savings or expenses.<br/><br/>

The `TrustyFactory` (contract generator and deployer of single trusty multi-signature contract) along with the dApp can be used as a bundle for companies to manage internal employees payments or interactions with other companies in the market that has integrated the smart contracts eco-system.<br/><br/>

The factory is rather modular and adaptable therefore, in addition to acting as a service that delivers and deploys Trusty vaults for users upon payment of a commission, it can also be "installed" for internal services or scaled for any use-case where management/multiple validation/mediation is needed.<br/><br/>

A single Trusty can be a corporate vault managed by a few directors or actors delegated to, or several Trustys Vaults can act as tools for operating capital for various departments each with its own fund but with the common supervision of a Externally Owned Account's private key or two of the administrators and, if desired, can also be used for the internal payment of employees.

It can be used as a deposit fund or as an interaction tool for DeFi, or simply as an NFT or Token management wallet, a bit like a mini-DAO between individuals or several Trusties together.<br/><br/>

The trusty can also be seen as a mini governance/DAO that uses funds to interact on the web3 as if it were a unique wallet/entity.<br/><br/>

All large amounts of capital in crypto all use multi-signature wallets on purpose because they are a high level of security.

It goes without saying that it could be adapted very well in the mediation of the use-cases identified in the real estate sector, logistic, crowdfunding, etc…<br/><br/>

- [You access Trusty App and enter the addresses or Ethereum Name Service (ENS) of the other two owners/validators with which to create a multi-signature wallet and select the minimum number of confirmations that Trusty will need to spend the funds and execute transactions depending on configuration needed.]<br/><br/>

- [Once you have created your Trusty, the address will appear in the dApp and an interface for managing its transactions which allows you to deposit funds in the Trusty and create transactions which can then be confirmed/revoked/executed by the other validators/owners of the Trusty.]<br/><br/>

- [If instead you are the creator or owner of a Trusty, the TXs proposed by the other owners will appear, if existing, ready for confirmation and execution.]<br/><br/>

- [* The use of ENS works if you have registered the domain on Goerli otherwise it does not identify the associated address]<br/><br/>

The creation of a trusty/wallet/vault takes place upon payment of the service with ? ETH + fee (currently 0 ETH + fee on TestNet) to the TrustyFactory (the Smart-Contract generator of single Trusty smart-contracts of which only the owner/deployer can withdraw the funds )<br/><br/>
The subsequent deposit of funds (management of the trusty) can be mediated by the TrustyFactory (which "if desired" could retain a percentage of the deposits (mediation and costs for the chain management of operations on Trustys).

A trusty can interact with other contracts at will by calling their functions.<br/><br/>

- Example: I send a tx to the trusty by setting the "data" parameter in order to spend the funds to call a contract function such as that of the AAVE protocol to deposit collateral or to mint an NFT or a fungible Token from a contract which issues ERC20,ERC721,ERC115 tokens.
Just indicate in the "data" field (now disabled) the name of the function to call and in the "to" field of course the contract with which to interact.
